# Citation Styles {.unnumbered}

There are *many* citation styles available for your use. Quarto uses the Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS) by default but you can include any of the [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) (CSL) files from [this official GitHub repository](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles) to use instead.  

Here, I am using the `apa.csl` file to implement American Psychological Association (APA) formatting for my reference list. To obtain and use a CSL file in your Quarto book, go to the [repo](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles), scroll through until you find one you want, click on it, and download the raw file. Put that in your Quarto files and then update your .yml file to contain `csl: <myfile>.csl".
