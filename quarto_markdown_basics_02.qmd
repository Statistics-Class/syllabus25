## Images

### Just the image

Write `![This is a photo of a bridge.](img/bridge.png)` to produce:

![This is a photo of a bridge.](img/bridge.png)

### An Image as a link

Add square brackets and a link in parentheses like this: `[![This is a photo of a bridge.](img/bridge.png)](https://www.patreon.com/adamsantone_phd)` to create a linked image like this:

[![This is a linked photo of a bridge you can click to visit my Patreon page.](img/bridge.png)](https://www.patreon.com/adamsantone_phd)

### A linked image with a pop-up description

To create a pop-up label that appears when a user hovers over the image with their cursor, add text in quotes like this: `[![This is a photo of a bridge.](img/bridge.png)](https://www.patreon.com/adamsantone_phd "A bridge!")` to create a linked image like this:

[![This is a linked photo of a bridge with a pop-up description.](img/bridge.png)](https://www.patreon.com/adamsantone_phd "A bridge!")

### A linked image with alt-text

For even better accessibility, you should add alt-text like this: `[![This is a photo of a bridge.](img/bridge.png){fig-alt="Alt text for the bridge image."}](https://www.patreon.com/adamsantone_phd "A bridge")`.

[![This is a linked photo of a bridge with alt-text and a pop-up description.](img/bridge.png){fig-alt="Alt text for the bridge image."}](https://www.patreon.com/adamsantone_phd)
